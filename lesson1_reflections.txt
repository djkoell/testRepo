Reflections on viewing diff between two versions help find bugs?

I didn't have to get bogged down with all the content that was the same.  Eyes immediately pulled to the diffs.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can watch changes happen. 
You can see who made changes.
You can see how functions evolved.
You can find out when a bug was introduced and understand if other things need to be rolled back...
